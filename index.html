                <p class="flex w-1/2 ml-28 mt-16 text-white font-normal ">Gol D. Roger was known as the “Pirate King,”
                    the
                    strongest and most infamous being to have sailed the
                    Grand Line. The capture and execution of Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout
                    the
                    world. His last words before his death revealed the existence of the greatest treasure in the world,
                    One
                    Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of
                    finding
                    One Piece—which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame—and quite possibly the pinnacle of
                    glory
                    and the title of the Pirate King. Enter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who defies your standard
                    definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate
                    ransacking villages for fun, Luffy’s reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder: the thought of
                    an
                    exciting adventure that leads him to intriguing people and ultimately, the promised treasure.
                    Following
                    in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line,
                    experiencing
                    crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach the
                    most
                    coveted of all fortunes—One Piece. [Written by MAL Rewrite]............................
